# Pluto [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/aukbit/pluto.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/aukbit/pluto)
An implementation of microservices with golang to tackle some of the challenges in distributed systems.
### Features
- Currently supports a multiplexer HTTP router with dynamic paths and still compatible with the standard net/http library.
- Client/Server implementation with [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) for communication between services.
- Service health check.
- Structured Logs by using [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).

### Pluto - Hello World

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/aukbit/pluto"
	"github.com/aukbit/pluto/reply"
	"github.com/aukbit/pluto/server"
	"github.com/aukbit/pluto/server/router"
)

func main() {
	// Define router
	mux := router.New()
	mux.GET("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		reply.Json(w, r, http.StatusOK, "Hello World")
	})

	// Define http server
	srv := server.New(
		server.Mux(mux),
	)

	// Define Pluto service
	s := pluto.New(
		pluto.Servers(srv),
	)

	// Run Pluto service
	if err := s.Run(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

```sh
go run ./examples/hello/main.go
